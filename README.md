# DiscordBot
A personal bot that helps manages a large server in Discord

Here are some of the commands:

1. $inspire : shows a bot-generated inspirational quote by an external website called inspireobot.me (sometimes show some innapropriate pictures)
2. $meme : sends a random meme template
3. $setRole [@user] @role : set a user or multiple users into a single role
4. $deleteRole [@user] @role: deletes a role from a user or group
5. dadbot : when sending "i'm" into the server, the bot responds with "hi [phrase], I'm dad".
ex) user: "Man I'm tired", bot-response: "hi tired, I'm dad"

To use this bot, install node and the zipped folder. Then, type "node ." in the terminal. You will also need to set up a bot with admin permissions with the [discord permissions calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html). Finally, you will need to find your client id and token id for your bot using the (discord applications website)[https://discord.com/developers/applications]
